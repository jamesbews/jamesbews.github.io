                <p>John Deere, born in 1804, opened a shop in Grand Detour, Illinois where he intended to work as a repairman for the village. Deere saw a need to produce a new type of plow, one that would prevent the rich midwestern soil from becoming stuck.
                He fashioned a new plow from a steel saw blade and thus became the beginnings of John Deere in the agricultural business.</p>

        <li class="day">
            <div class="info">
                <p>John Deere's work began to increase in popularity due to an innovative business model that saw John Deere produce plows before an order had been placed. This caused sales to rise exponentially as farmers could purchases and begin using a plow
                in the same day. John Deere moved operations to Moline, Illinois in 1848 to gain access to the railroad and build a new factory where they would increase yearly plow production from 100 in 1842 to over 1000 in 1857.
                John Deere and his stakeholders incorporated as Deere & Company in 1868, with John's son Charles as the primary stakeholder. Production of farm implements expanded to wagons, planters and cultivators through to the
                beginning of the 20th century.</p>

                production tractor, the Dain All-Wheel Drive. Price: $700.</p>

                    Later models replaced the steel wheels with rubber to add comfort and safety for an added road gear. The Model D still holds the longest production run, from 1923 - 1953. Original sale price: $1000</p>
